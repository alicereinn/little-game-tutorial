Multiple spritesheet, import this correctly by setting to multiple and slicing the sprites by cell size.

Tilemap is a 2D object. Create it from the Objects view.
Select Rectangular if a type is needed.

To use this we need a tile palette. Create a new palette from the Window dropdown, call it Ground (for instance).
Save in Assets/Tile Palettes folder.
Drag Overworld multiple sprite into the tile palette itself, let import.

IMPORTANT!!! For Rect Tool issues with Tilemaps, need to use Compress Tilemap Bounds.
This is because the total area of the tilemap also includes previously existing and then deleted tiles.

The physics for the character should be in FixedUpdate, and the Transform should not bnbe changed directly.
Need to use MovePosition instead.
