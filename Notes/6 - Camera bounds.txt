Remember to use snap to grid in the view to cleanly move the camera for the upper and lower bounding!
Use function called Clamp to bound the camera between these x and y values. This is done before the Lerp on the target position.
Need a calculation to find the correct stopping point for the camera, and the camera size must be a variable in this.
